Diophantine equation

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
x2 - Dy2 = 1
For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 - 13 x 1802 = 1.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.
By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:
32 - 2 x 22 = 1
22 - 3 x 12 = 192 - 5 x 42 = 1
52 - 6 x 22 = 1
82 - 7 x 32 = 1
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D <= 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.
Find the value of D <= 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.
